Upon downloading the codes
1. Open terminal as an administrator(just to be sure)
2. Navigate to the directory where you found this txt file. 
3. Execute 'npm install'. This is so that all dependencies will be installed. 
4. Once done, to open the app, execute 'npm start'.


Comments:
1. I took note from the instructions that you will be looking for simple, performant and well written code. 
I was very careful not to overkill the small application with redux. So I didn't use redux but I can do that if you want me to. 
2. I heard from joseph that the url for the details page should be different so I used react-router-dom to do that.
3. As I was staring at the fonts in the sketch file, I don't think it's either Arial or Georgia. But I settled with Arial since it looks close.
4. I added a link back to "/" or home in the svg (ADRENALIN) for easier navigation.
5. I used an inline format for the list. It stacks from left to right, top to bottom. I did this so that the "list" will flow through the page downwards. I didn't use any grid layout from bootstrap and the like as it defeats the purpose of having a possibly dynamic list of items. Hence the inline <card> components. I made sure it always takes 50% of it's container so it the view will always have 2 columns.


Thank you so much for this opportunity. I refreshed my knowledge a lot. I hope I did well :)
